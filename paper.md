# Abstract

Music and mathematics are two subjects more related to one-another than most
people know. A single melody can be thought of as a sequence of changing pitch
frequency intervals, along side a sequence of rhythmic durations. In this
project we will first explore ways in which to translate musical melodies into
real-valued numerical sequences, and second we will study these sequences by
applying familiar fractal dimension metrics in an attempt to explore fractal
patterns in music and build insight into "fractal music" really means.
