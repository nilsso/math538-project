present a 20-25 minutes slide or power point presentation that will be judged by
the rest of the class, the instructor and other faculty members that will attend
the presentations.

The teams must also submit a formal project (very much in the style of a journal
publication). The report should not exceed 20 pages (including all graphic
material) and should include:
- Title, authors, affiliations.
- Abstract.
- Introductory background material on the literature and significance of the
  project.
- Development of the mathematical model or a survey of a collection of relevant
  models.
- Discussion on the relevant mathematical theory that applies.
- Some original work on your own for either extending the model and performing
  simulations.
- Discussion and conclusions to summarize your work.
- References.

# Abstract

Music and mathematics are two subjects more related to one-another than most
people know. A single melody can be thought of as a sequence of changing pitch
frequency intervals, along side a sequence of rhythmic durations. In this
project we will first explore ways in which to translate musical melodies into
real-valued numerical sequences, and second we will study these sequences by
applying familiar fractal dimension metrics in an attempt to explore fractal
patterns in music and build insight into what "fractal music" really means.
